        <title>Talk about getting distracted!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to start this blog/site because I have several ideas I want to write about
before I get distracted by something else and forget them. I then proceeded to spend the
rest of the day getting distracted by learning about &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, the 
software that I&amp;#39;m using to create the site. Sigh... Well, at least it was educational.&lt;/p&gt;
