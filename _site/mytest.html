<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Dean Brettle and I&#39;m an unabashed computer, math, and science geek. I started programming in 1980 at age 10 (on a TRS-80 Color Computer). After graduating from Caltech in 1992, I did software development and technology consulting, specializing in pattern recognition, image processing, control systems, and computer security. In 2004 I quit to raise my two kids. I&#39;ve now been homeschooling them since kindergarten. </p>

<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p>One of the most common excuses my kids give for not getting their school work done is &quot;I got distracted&quot;. As frustrating as hearing that can be, the truth is that I often get distracted as well. This site/blog is for projects and ideas which distract me and/or from which I was or might be distracted. The idea is that writing about these ideas publicly will:</p>

<ul>
<li>force me to be at least somewhat more rigorous in my thinking, </li>
<li>provide a written record so that it will be easier for me to return to an idea later,</li>
<li>allow me to get feedback on the ideas and/or for others to run with them,</li>
</ul>
