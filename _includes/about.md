### About Me

My name is Dean Brettle and I'm a proud computer, math, and science geek. I started programming in 1980 at age 10 (on a TRS-80 Color Computer). After graduating from Caltech in 1992, I did software development and technology consulting, specializing in pattern recognition, image processing, control systems, and computer security. In 2004 I quit to raise my two kids. I've now been homeschooling them since kindergarten. 

### About This Site

One of the most common excuses my kids give for not getting their school work done is "I got distracted". As frustrating as hearing that can be, the truth is that I often get distracted as well. This site/blog is for projects and ideas which distract me and/or from which I was or might be distracted. The idea is that writing about these ideas publicly will:

* force me to be at least somewhat more rigorous in my thinking, 
* provide a written record so that it will be easier for me to return to an idea later,
* allow me to get feedback on the ideas and/or for others to run with them,
