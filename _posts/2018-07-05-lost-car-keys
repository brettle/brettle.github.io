My daughter lost her car key. They are probably in her room somewhere but we've spent days looking for them. The keys are "smart keys" which means that you don't need to take them out of your pocket to get in the car -- you simply press a button on the door handle and the car sends a signal to the key that the key responds to. If we could move the car around her room while pressing the button we could probably use it to find the lost key. Obviously that's not practical, so I spent a few days getting distracted by researching what a hardware solution might look like. I've documented my research [here](https://github.com/brettle/smartkeyfinder)
